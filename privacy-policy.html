            <p>
                Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier which is a string
                of letters and numbers that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored
                by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
                requests a page from the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us
                analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it
                to the visitor’s needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes
                and then the data is removed from the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to
                monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives
                us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you
                choose to share with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
                if you prefer. However, this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the
                website.
